Where Is Your Heart does as well. Walk Away is outstanding, and You Found Me is completely incredible. I Hate Myself For Losing You has great lyrics and vocals. Hear Me is a very good song, and like all of Kelly Clarkson's songs, the vocals are unbelievable. The final track on the album is called Beautiful Disaster. It is the live version that Kelly sang on the finale of American Idol Season 3. That is a fantastic song as well, and you will love it no matter what type of music you like.",

Breakaway is an amazing song with great vocals and range, Since You Been Gone is a hard rock song wich is very difficult to sing, yet Kelly does a great job. Behind These Hazel Eyes is also a fantastic song. Because Of You has amazing lyrics and vocals. Gone is a powerful song vocally. Addicted also has meaningful lyrics and vocals.

After listenin to this album a few times you will be blown away by the incredible emotion and deep lyrics and still great background vocals in every song.

OTR rises above the label of 'pop'. in fact, if you enjoy OTR, you should check out chris brown and kate fenner ... they are at least as compelling as OTR (and my favorite, by the way).",

A quite superb blend of guitar and amazing vocal skill, quite exceptional lyrics and true feeling.Dizzy - A great opening track with hard hitting guitar and skilled vocals, with a grabbing chorus - 4/5Slide - A brilliant piece of memorable lyrics, a great guitar riff and a brilliant atmosphere. 5/5Broadway - As above really. A slightly more rocky, but more meaningful, song. Brilliant. 5/5January Friend - A failing in this album is the slightly weaker songs produced vocally by Robbie, but this is one of the two stronger ones. 3.5-4/5Black Balloon - A beautifully blended guitar and vocals, with insightful lyrics and a lovely melodic line. My personal favourite. 5/5Bullet Proof - A hard-rocking, guitar leading song, with good vocals and pleasing lyrics. 4/5Amigone - The second of Robbie's good vocal songs on this album. Guitar plays a rapid rhythm through nice vocals, bringing together a very pleasing song. 4/5All Eyes on Me - A brilliant lyrically crafted song set around a hard guitar riff. Though not complex, the musical simplicity brings out the billiance of the lyrics. 4.5-5 /5Full Forever - I have almost never listened to this song. Feel free to press the skip button on your CD player, this &quot;Robbie Classic&quot; is one to miss. N/A / 5Acoustic #3 - Brillaint lyrics, lovely guitar riff, excellent vocals. Words cannot express the feelings this produces - listen to it! 5/5Iris - As above. Passionate, the leading song in the singles released by GGD's, lovely acoustis intro, electric guitar takes over very professionally, amazing lyrics and vocals. Prepare to be stunned. 5/5Extra Pale - Poor. Avoid. Another &quot;Robbie Classic&quot;. 2/5Hate this Place - An example of what rock can be if in the capable vocal 'hands' of Johnny Rzeznik. A passionate, quick moving song with amazing vocals and hard guitaring. the best rock song on the album. 5/5Overall, despite the poorer aspects of the album (mainly Robby's songs, which are rectified in the new Gutterflower album), this is full of classic songs and amazing lyrics. A must have.Simon",

The vocals rule and the lyrics send chills down my spine. The chiming of the bells at the beginning and end sound really coolDisciples of the Lie: This song is fast and heavy and will get your head bangin. It has a very haunting keyboard solo in the middle.Consequences: this song is beautiful, a slow and soft one with great vocalsProphecy: The best song in the trilogy and possibly the best on the album. It starts eerie and soft and then there is a short bass the solo that kicks this song up to speed. Great lyrics, vocals, and guitar workThis album is a must have for any metal fan",
