Blues Deluxe seems all that more amazing because a following blues-tinged Joe Bonamassa cd, You and Me, is a big disapointment compared to the outstanding blues music, vocals, and guitar playing that are found on Blues Deluxe. I've listened to Blues Deluxe a large number of times, and the cd never fails to fascinate my rock blues and blues tastes. Every song on Blues Deluxe is outstanding blues. Joe Bonamassa does a superb job of singing and playing THE BLUES-Blues Deluxe is also among my most treasured blues cds! If you enjor blues and/or rock blues music, I very strongly and confidently recommend Blues Deluxe to you. The cd is so well done that I consider it a masterpiece.John",

I love to listen to Deep Blues. I am fascinated by Deep Blues and will definitely continue to regularly and truly enjoy Deep Blues long after my first rush of playing the cd time after time is past. In fact, so far I've enjoyed Deep Blues a bit more every time that I listen to it. Ronnie Earl is certainly a highly accomplished guitarist! The Broadcasters are a very tight and very competent band that sound a bit like Robert Cray's band without the horns. Both vocalists, Kim Wilson and Sugar Ray Norcia, are wonderful blues singers! Another very positive quality of Deep Blues is that all of the songs on the cd are definitely excellent BLUES! Therefore, the title of this cd is very appropriate. If you are a discerning blues fan, you can enjoy listening to each and every song on Deep Blues without flipping past a song that seems poor or out of place. Another very positive quality of Deep Blues is that the music has a \"stripped-down to just the right basics, almost live, although recorded in the studio\" feel to it. Deep Blues, as is true of many other cds, could benefit from some remastering, at least on some of the songs. But, and this is important, the sound quality of Deep Blues is certainly clear enough to truly enjoy listening to all of the music on the cd, without any distractions, just the way it is! Overall, I very highly recommend Deep Blues to you. I truly think you'll enjoy it. (One month later and Deep Blues is still the primary cd that I am listening to and enjoyng. Deep Blues is simply a MASTERPIECE OF THE BLUES! I also ordered and have listened to Heart and Soul: The Best of Ronnie Earl, which is not as good a blues cd as is Deep Blues. I'm of the opinion that DEEP BLUES is the ONE VERY BEST RONNIE EARL CD TO OWN AND PLAY due to the excellent blues singing of Sugar Ray Norcia and Kim Wilson, along with Ronnie Earl's great guitar playing.)John",

The set contains 9 discs consisting first of three volumes of &quot;essentials&quot; in no particular order. These disc's mix all aspects of the genre and feature such artists as Hound Dog Taylor, Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Little Milton, Luther Allison, Magic Sam, Jimmy Reed and even a little James Brown. The next two disc's break the blues down into two of the more better known and easily recognized styles, Chicago Blues--featuring the likes of Sonny Boy Williamson, Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter-and Texas Blues-featuring Smokin' Joe Kubek, Lou Ann Barton, Gatemouth Brown and Lightnin' Hopkins. Then there are three discs each dedicated to a traditional blues instruments. You get Blues Guitar, Blues Harmonica and Blues Piano. Each of these three discs features individuals that have made those instruments popular among blues aficionados such as Elmore James, Muddy Waters, BB King and Bo Diddley on guitar, Charlie Musselwhite, Frank Frost and Junior Wells on harp and Pinetop Perkins, Roosevelt Sykes and Katie Webster on piano. Finally, you have one disc dedicated solely to the Woman of the Blues featuring, Marcia Ball, Nina Simone, Francine Reed and Ruth Brown. While there are many aspects of the blues not covered here, such as Mississippi Blues, Delta Blues, Country Blues, Acoustic Blues and many others, House of Blues did an exceptional job at collecting songs that will encourage listeners to seek out various performers and, ultimately new performers that have been influenced by the artists featured here. If you don't want to spring for the whole box, many of these discs are available for purchase individually in the House of Blues Series including one not in this box set, the excellent Smokey Blues featuring Mitch Woods, Charles Brown and Pee Wee Crayton.",

Every song on this cd is a great and deep pleasure to listen to and appreciate. Susan Tedeschi is an outstanding singer and her band provides her with what sounds like perfect accompaniment for her expressive voice. In addition, the songs themselves have enough variety in tempo and feel so that every song on the cd stands out as unique and important. Therefore the person who listens to The Best of Susan Tedeschi Episode Two will never get bored because \"all the music sounds the same.\" The cd includes 11 studio recordings and two live recordings, further enhancing the variety of blues songs found on this cd. The question that is apparently in vogue today among blues music fans is: \"What music is the blues and what music is not the blues among songs and cds that are currently advertised as a form of the blues by Amazon and other musical distributors?\" I myself have addressed this question a number of times as I have listened to and either liked or not liked a number of artists and cds that Amazon currently advertises as blues or rock blues. Some people have even questioned Susan Tedeschi's integrity as a blues musician. I believe that these skeptics of Susan Tedeschi are completely wrong. As far as I am concerned, Susan Tedeschi, and all of the music presented on The Best of Susan Tedeschi Episode Two, should be uncompromisingly classified as \"the blues\" for as long as the best music of the great Freddie King, a past blues artist and hero and mentor to many current blues artists, is also classified as \"the blues.\" Both Freddie King and Susan Tedeschi expand our understanding of the blues just a bit, as great blues artists should do, at the same time that their music retains a blues character. I for one am intrigued and a bit amazed by Susan Tedeschi's great blues insight because she recognized that John Prine's Angel From Montgomery is very much a blues song (as did Bonnie Raitt). I most highly recommend The Best of Susan Tedeschi Episode Two to you. The blues music on this cd is outstanding.John",

Tony Monaco is a superb performer on the Hammond B3 organ and frequently his endeavors fall into the category of soul jazz. Soul jazz is a genre of jazz in which the musicians often employ the talents of an organist to carry the \"groove\" throughout their performance. The talents of Tony Monaco are conspicuously evident and the driving force for the eleven songs on this recording of 54 minutes of bonafide blues.Willie Pooch is a man who has lived the blues and his character is as authentic as the idiom of blues he professes to sing. Without doubt he is \"blues to the bone\". He penned the lyrics to \"House Arrest Blues\", \"Cross My Heart Blues\", \"Buckeye Steel Mill Blues\", \"In My Lonely Room\", and \"Willie Rap\" which testify to his understanding and feeling for the sometimes poignant and always personal expression that has always been at the core of blues.Some blues artists come up short on the credibility aspect of their music; Willie Pooch is not one of them ... he is \"the real deal\" and this CD captures the essence of why authentic blues singers sing the blues. Because living has tested his character, Willie's blues testify to life's lessons learned. Together Tony Monaco and Willie Pooch have created a blues masterpiece ... and hopefully their collaboration and convictions for playing the nitty-gritty will continue ... the blues, \"pure and simple\", distilled from life's hard earned lessons.",

Their playing transcends genre and falls in the category of sheer musical genius. I can't pick a favorite song on Is The Blues. Walking The Blues is almost as powerful a project.,HAving more of a variety of vocals is enjoyable. St. Louis Jimmy Oden was on e wonderful singer. All in all, both discs are a piece of history, blues at it's purest and finest. Reccomended to all blues lovers.",

Koko has the ability to reach down into the soul of the blues, and give an edge never before seen by a blues performer. She is an inspiration to classical blues, and I think this album, which was recorded in the late 60's gives way to a whole new generation of blues singing. I would highly suggest to the avid blues enthuist to at least listen to a sample of Koko's songs and see for yourself. If the blues are not in your soul, you cannot enjoy some of the best female vocalist blues of this century.",

King does on the guitar. The first song of this album, &quot;Worried Blues&quot; performed by other blues men such as James Cotton sounds very gloomy. But Big Maceo is the one who is able to play this song cheerfully and nicely. This is one of the most important blues albums for blues pianists. This CD contains many essential blues piano idioms, and very educational. 'Click'",
