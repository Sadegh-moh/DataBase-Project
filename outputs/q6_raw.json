And she accomplished her goal. The girls in this video have fun doing what they do. They know just who they are and indulge themselves by bringing their unique personality and style to each performance.In addition to plenty of fantastic and wild striptease segments and photo shoots, we get to hear the voices of each of the girls. They tell us tales of being on the road with their friends, of the joys of loving one's body and sharing it with the world, of just being who they are. We watch them strip naked and try to catch cabs in San Francisco (with surprising difficulty). We hear one girl's tale of how she made a guy need stitches. We see them whip and smack each other on stage as a way or relieving the frustrations of sitting in a van with each other for 8 hours.Everything out of these girls' mouths just feels positive and empowering. And every sexy pose and dance, filled with color and confidence, is even more so. This is an overall fun documentary about what it means to be part of the Suicide Girl movement and I hope you come along for the ride.",

Though always a talented songwriter and performer, her work has gone largely unnoticed by the general public. That is, until this beautiful collection of songs surprised new fans, and left the rest of us saying, &quot;I told you so!&quot; The first track, &quot;One&quot;, a cover of the classic Three Dog Night tune, is an appropriate album opener, and is quite reflexive of the themes and attitudes that defined the movie. I just love her voice and the instrumentation on this track, and believe wholeheartedly that it is a great and positive representation of the original recording. Deathly is a superb pop song, and was the catalyst in the writing of the script for the film. A truly inspiring piece of music. You Do is one of my favorites on the album, again a perfectly constructed and delivered pop song. Wise Up is tear-jerker, and an obviously complementary song for the big screen, having once been featured in the film Jerry MaGuire. I happen to love the Supertramp songs tacked on at the end, and feel that they play an equally important role in the overall feel of the film. I could do without the cheesy and out of place song &quot;Dreams&quot; by Gabrielle (?). It really takes you out of the emotional impact that the rest of the music on the record inspires.A surreal and beautiful movie, with an equally captivating soundtrack.",

The song and music video are both excellent tools in helping a lonely person realize that they are not alone and that they too can be successful in learning how to cope with the problem and lead a productive life. The song is about a young person who is all alone, lacking the necessary friends and relationships which are crucially vital in helping young people thrive and prosper. When a person is battling loneliness, they may feel all alone and think that they are the only person in the world with the problem. However, the repetitive lyrics, &quot;You don't have to be the lonely one&quot; send a positive message informing us that although we may FEEL alone, we are NOT alone, that there are other people, in fact, many people who are dealing with the problem and share the same feelings. The lyrics are telling us that we do not, in fact, have to be the lonely one. That there is something we can do about it. That we don't have to let it control us, that it is able to be coped with successfully. That makes us stronger and thus more confident. It helps us realize that in time, we will find the friends or relationships we are looking for and realistically, they could very well have the same feelings of loneliness. That's also what the lyrics mean, that we don't have to be lonely because there are other people out in this world who are also looking for the right person and have the same feelings. Realizing this, gives us comfort. I would HIGHLY recommend this cd single because it is not only an excellent dance song, but is a weapon as well.",

          "text": "&quot;The Lonely One&quot; is an excellent cd single which is not just pleasurable but a gift as well. The song and music video are both excellent tools in helping a lonely person realize that they are not alone and that they too can be successful in learning how to cope with the problem and lead a productive life. The song is about a young person who is all alone, lacking the necessary friends and relationships which are crucially vital in helping young people thrive and prosper. When a person is battling loneliness, they may feel all alone and think that they are the only person in the world with the problem. However, the repetitive lyrics, &quot;You don't have to be the lonely one&quot; send a positive message informing us that although we may FEEL alone, we are NOT alone, that there are other people, in fact, many people who are dealing with the problem and share the same feelings. The lyrics are telling us that we do not, in fact, have to be the lonely one. That there is something we can do about it. That we don't have to let it control us, that it is able to be coped with successfully. That makes us stronger and thus more confident. It helps us realize that in time, we will find the friends or relationships we are looking for and realistically, they could very well have the same feelings of loneliness. That's also what the lyrics mean, that we don't have to be lonely because there are other people out in this world who are also looking for the right person and have the same feelings. Realizing this, gives us comfort. I would HIGHLY recommend this cd single because it is not only an excellent dance song, but is a weapon as well.",

Alive!Time-lapse review:3 YEARS AGO: My only problem with this record was that I needed a second copy to listen to while washing dishes, because my six year old listened to it every night while falling asleep. The first time I put it on for him, he reported \"It's like it goes in here [ears] and then down here [heart]. It's so good, it's great.\" I think this record is fundamental enough for almost anyone, but fresh enough to be of great value. It has great melodies and refreshing uplifting ideas recorded in a pleasant voice. It's substantial and honest, full of sincere life. It truly sounds inspired. (It's NOTHING like a lot of modern superficial & depressive \"praise & worship\" noise.)UPDATE: my son is eight now, and while he's listened to other records including several Beatles albums, he's still choosing Love & Thunder for his bed-time music almost every single night.UPDATE: my son is turning 9 and no longer listens to music while falling asleep, but we still like to listen to this record, especially when we need to calm down and move into more a positive mood.-----------",

If one is able to feel all the songs here he/she would cry in tears of joy for God and divine love.The voices of the SRF nuns are beautiful and enchanting. Songs such as \"Hymn to Brahma\" and \"Satchidananda Guru\" would inspire any seeker of God to intensify their spiritual practices and increase their devotion for God and Truth.These compositions of music also prove that Yogananda has a great talent for musical notes and poetry. The SRF nuns were able to generate an atmosphere of love and reverence for their Guru through this recording. It also shows us that these nuns were singing for God and not to please the general public. Their minds were always on God and Guru.For those people who are inclined to be pessimistic and depressed, this piece of music would prove to be an invaluable gift to them. It would enable them to view life in a more positive note!",

          "text": "I was searching desperately for that sound, that 80's upbeat sound that I've heard on the radio a few times but never knew who created it. When I heard &quot;It's my Life&quot; on the radio, and heard it was by Bon Jovi, I finally heard that sound, a song I can relate to. I'm almost constantly looking for inspiration in my life, and the lyrics of that song helped fill a pleasant void.Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Amazing, simply amazing. I thought 'It's my life' was great, now here are 8 other songs that are just as good, or better! After listening to this album, I quickly ran up to best buy and bought their crossroads cd. I am now addicted to Bon Jovi music, and Crush started this addiction. Here's my little breakdown of each song (I've placed Bon Jovi songs into three categories: Passionate-'livin' on a prayer' and 'you give love a bad name' type songs; Fun-'Bad medicine' and 'Wanted dead or alive' type songs and Ballad-'Always' and 'Bed of Roses' type songs):1 It's my life-(passionate) This is exactly what I've been thinking for the past year, and this song helped channel my thoughts to music. Very upbeat and passionate, advancement to the &quot;livin' on a prayer&quot; tune in theme and sound. When Jon sings &quot;It's my life, it's now or never, I aint gonna live forever&quot; if you're not yelling it out loud with him, perhaps you should re-examine your current life situation. Rated 10/102 Say it aint so-(fun) This song is quite different form the rest of Bon Jovi music, and I didn't like it initially, but it is growing on me, and reminds me of current rock with a touch of the beatles. Rated 9/103 Thank you for loving me-(ballad) Ah, their first new ballad on the CD. This really is great stuff right here. The vocals and music, like any other of their ballads, are seamless and very emotional. Like many others have said, this is a perfect marriage tune right here. Rated: 10/104 Two Story Town-(fun) Lyrics are fun, music is very catchy, and this is REAL music, unlike the &quot;music&quot; on the radios today. Inspiring message: Do not live your life in moderation. Rated: 9/105 Next 100 years-(passionate) The beginning of this song is almost too incredible, the song doesn't quite live up to the beginning, but it is a great song nonetheless. Vocal are awesome (It is Bon Jovi...) Rated: 10/106 Just Older-(passionate) Although I really can't relate to this song's message (I'm only 17...), the sound of this song, more than any other, has the old 80s sound to it. One of the heavier tunes on this relatively softer album, Just Older is both passionate and fun. Rated: 10/107 Mystery Train-(passsionate/ballad) Album's first low point, not a bad song at all (it's pretty good actually), it just doesn't live up to the rest of the amazing songs throughout the rest of the album. It's not as loving as a ballad, and not as exciting as a passionate song which renders it a little of an odd ball. Rated: 7/108 Save the World-(ballad) The opening vocals may be a little tedious, but the rest of the song is nothing less than heaven sent, it really is the best chorus Bon Jovi has ever written. Simply marvelous in every respect, if you're not in the lovey-dovey mood after this, nothing can save you. Rated: 10/109 Captain Crash &amp; the Beauty Queen from Mars-(fun) This song is pure fun, and there isn't a more upbeat and smile inducing song on this CD. Great guitar and drum work, vocals are very fun. Rated: 10/1010 She's a Mystery-(ballad?) Uh, every cd has them, even an amazing cd such as this has its low points, and this is one of them. The music is pretty boring, and this only makes the vocals sound even more out of place. Rated: 3/1011 I Got the Girl-(fun) And here's the only other low point of the cd. The chorus is very cheesy and reminds me of 'Lay your hands on me', but at least that song was decent, this is a proportional disaster. Oh well... Rated: 2/1012 One Wild Night-(fun) So does the cd end on a positive note? I say so. Bon Jovi ends with very catchy (and heavy) tune. The beginning and end of this song are pretty cheesy though and should be ignored... Rated: 8/10If you you're in search of really great music that truly has an inspiring message behind it, I beg you to purchase this album. It'll only cost [several dollars], but the joy and inspiration you draw from the music may be priceless (if you're anything like me). Good luck!",

Rated: 10/106 Just Older-(passionate) Although I really can't relate to this song's message (I'm only 17...), the sound of this song, more than any other, has the old 80s sound to it. One of the heavier tunes on this relatively softer album, Just Older is both passionate and fun. Rated: 10/107 Mystery Train-(passsionate/ballad) Album's first low point, not a bad song at all (it's pretty good actually), it just doesn't live up to the rest of the amazing songs throughout the rest of the album. It's not as loving as a ballad, and not as exciting as a passionate song which renders it a little of an odd ball. Rated: 7/108 Save the World-(ballad) The opening vocals may be a little tedious, but the rest of the song is nothing less than heaven sent, it really is the best chorus Bon Jovi has ever written. Simply marvelous in every respect, if you're not in the lovey-dovey mood after this, nothing can save you. Rated: 10/109 Captain Crash &amp; the Beauty Queen from Mars-(fun) This song is pure fun, and there isn't a more upbeat and smile inducing song on this CD. Great guitar and drum work, vocals are very fun. Rated: 10/1010 She's a Mystery-(ballad?) Uh, every cd has them, even an amazing cd such as this has its low points, and this is one of them. The music is pretty boring, and this only makes the vocals sound even more out of place. Rated: 3/1011 I Got the Girl-(fun) And here's the only other low point of the cd. The chorus is very cheesy and reminds me of 'Lay your hands on me', but at least that song was decent, this is a proportional disaster. Oh well... Rated: 2/1012 One Wild Night-(fun) So does the cd end on a positive note? I say so. Bon Jovi ends with very catchy (and heavy) tune. The beginning and end of this song are pretty cheesy though and should be ignored... Rated: 8/10If you you're in search of really great music that truly has an inspiring message behind it, I beg you to purchase this album. It'll only cost [several dollars], but the joy and inspiration you draw from the music may be priceless (if you're anything like me). Good luck!",

When I heard &quot;It's my Life&quot; on the radio, and heard it was by Bon Jovi, I finally heard that sound, a song I can relate to. I'm almost constantly looking for inspiration in my life, and the lyrics of that song helped fill a pleasant void.Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Amazing, simply amazing. I thought 'It's my life' was great, now here are 8 other songs that are just as good, or better! After listening to this album, I quickly ran up to best buy and bought their crossroads cd. I am now addicted to Bon Jovi music, and Crush started this addiction. Here's my little breakdown of each song (I've placed Bon Jovi songs into three categories: Passionate-'livin' on a prayer' and 'you give love a bad name' type songs; Fun-'Bad medicine' and 'Wanted dead or alive' type songs and Ballad-'Always' and 'Bed of Roses' type songs):1 It's my life-(passionate) This is exactly what I've been thinking for the past year, and this song helped channel my thoughts to music. Very upbeat and passionate, advancement to the &quot;livin' on a prayer&quot; tune in theme and sound. When Jon sings &quot;It's my life, it's now or never, I aint gonna live forever&quot; if you're not yelling it out loud with him, perhaps you should re-examine your current life situation. Rated 10/102 Say it aint so-(fun) This song is quite different form the rest of Bon Jovi music, and I didn't like it initially, but it is growing on me, and reminds me of current rock with a touch of the beatles. Rated 9/103 Thank you for loving me-(ballad) Ah, their first new ballad on the CD. This really is great stuff right here. The vocals and music, like any other of their ballads, are seamless and very emotional. Like many others have said, this is a perfect marriage tune right here. Rated: 10/104 Two Story Town-(fun) Lyrics are fun, music is very catchy, and this is REAL music, unlike the &quot;music&quot; on the radios today.

The music is pretty boring, and this only makes the vocals sound even more out of place. Rated: 3/1011 I Got the Girl-(fun) And here's the only other low point of the cd. The chorus is very cheesy and reminds me of 'Lay your hands on me', but at least that song was decent, this is a proportional disaster. Oh well... Rated: 2/1012 One Wild Night-(fun) So does the cd end on a positive note? I say so. Bon Jovi ends with very catchy (and heavy) tune. The beginning and end of this song are pretty cheesy though and should be ignored... Rated: 8/10If you you're in search of really great music that truly has an inspiring message behind it, I beg you to purchase this album. It'll only cost [several dollars], but the joy and inspiration you draw from the music may be priceless (if you're anything like me). Good luck!",

          "text": "I was searching desperately for that sound, that 80's upbeat sound that I've heard on the radio a few times but never knew who created it. When I heard &quot;It's my Life&quot; on the radio, and heard it was by Bon Jovi, I finally heard that sound, a song I can relate to. I'm almost constantly looking for inspiration in my life, and the lyrics of that song helped fill a pleasant void.Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Amazing, simply amazing. I thought 'It's my life' was great, now here are 8 other songs that are just as good, or better! After listening to this album, I quickly ran up to best buy and bought their crossroads cd. I am now addicted to Bon Jovi music, and Crush started this addiction. Here's my little breakdown of each song (I've placed Bon Jovi songs into three categories: Passionate-'livin' on a prayer' and 'you give love a bad name' type songs; Fun-'Bad medicine' and 'Wanted dead or alive' type songs and Ballad-'Always' and 'Bed of Roses' type songs):1 It's my life-(passionate) This is exactly what I've been thinking for the past year, and this song helped channel my thoughts to music. Very upbeat and passionate, advancement to the &quot;livin' on a prayer&quot; tune in theme and sound. When Jon sings &quot;It's my life, it's now or never, I aint gonna live forever&quot; if you're not yelling it out loud with him, perhaps you should re-examine your current life situation. Rated 10/102 Say it aint so-(fun) This song is quite different form the rest of Bon Jovi music, and I didn't like it initially, but it is growing on me, and reminds me of current rock with a touch of the beatles. Rated 9/103 Thank you for loving me-(ballad) Ah, their first new ballad on the CD. This really is great stuff right here. The vocals and music, like any other of their ballads, are seamless and very emotional. Like many others have said, this is a perfect marriage tune right here. Rated: 10/104 Two Story Town-(fun) Lyrics are fun, music is very catchy, and this is REAL music, unlike the &quot;music&quot; on the radios today. Inspiring message: Do not live your life in moderation. Rated: 9/105 Next 100 years-(passionate) The beginning of this song is almost too incredible, the song doesn't quite live up to the beginning, but it is a great song nonetheless. Vocal are awesome (It is Bon Jovi...) Rated: 10/106 Just Older-(passionate) Although I really can't relate to this song's message (I'm only 17...), the sound of this song, more than any other, has the old 80s sound to it. One of the heavier tunes on this relatively softer album, Just Older is both passionate and fun. Rated: 10/107 Mystery Train-(passsionate/ballad) Album's first low point, not a bad song at all (it's pretty good actually), it just doesn't live up to the rest of the amazing songs throughout the rest of the album. It's not as loving as a ballad, and not as exciting as a passionate song which renders it a little of an odd ball. Rated: 7/108 Save the World-(ballad) The opening vocals may be a little tedious, but the rest of the song is nothing less than heaven sent, it really is the best chorus Bon Jovi has ever written. Simply marvelous in every respect, if you're not in the lovey-dovey mood after this, nothing can save you. Rated: 10/109 Captain Crash &amp; the Beauty Queen from Mars-(fun) This song is pure fun, and there isn't a more upbeat and smile inducing song on this CD. Great guitar and drum work, vocals are very fun. Rated: 10/1010 She's a Mystery-(ballad?) Uh, every cd has them, even an amazing cd such as this has its low points, and this is one of them.

The chorus is very cheesy and reminds me of 'Lay your hands on me', but at least that song was decent, this is a proportional disaster. Oh well... Rated: 2/1012 One Wild Night-(fun) So does the cd end on a positive note? I say so. Bon Jovi ends with very catchy (and heavy) tune. The beginning and end of this song are pretty cheesy though and should be ignored... Rated: 8/10If you you're in search of really great music that truly has an inspiring message behind it, I beg you to purchase this album.

Our favorite songs are : Sun shines for all the same, P.I:G., BugZZzz, and Lullaby. We took our family to Switzerland for Easter, and the long car ride to Verbier was this time for us quite painless because our children were happily busy trying to sing along and to memorize Meeka's beautiful songs. As a pedagogue, I would wholeheartedly encourage all parents concerned with providing their children a positive message about tolerance for all things living, to give their children the chance to hear this little girl's songs. We are forever grateful to our american cousins for introducing us and our kids to 'Meeka'.",

With the right exposure, I feel this new duo will touch and uplift many people, young and old. I want to wish them the very best and much success in their endeavor to spread the word of God where it is much needed during these trying times.

I've always believed that the man has a gift for writing and he's proven that with this latest album. What can I say, other than, you have to just listen to disc 2 U/Saved Me. The first track \"3-way call\" with Kelly Price and Kim Burrell, will touch your heart and spirit in ways that you couldn't even imagine if you tried. My eyes are still red from that one. In all of the songs, he wrote Truth! some may question whether it's Robert's truth, but I say to that, never the less it IS the Truth, the same truth that has stood the test of time! so I can relate to that, as I believe so many others will. Oh, I can't forget, \"Prayer Changes\"! that title speaks for itself, it's funny, I've been going through some challenging things lately, and believe me that one, came just in time! Robert will never know in totality the lives he has changed and made a positive impact in, via his music!I would be remiss if I didn't leave a quote from another favorite of mine on the U/Saved Me disc, and it's from the track entitled, \"The Diary of Me\", quote: \"My Past is Not What My Future Holds\"! yall that's some heart-wrenching, impacting, life changing Facts right there! Robert, continue to be used by the Almighty, it's a Gift and I thank God daily for the privilege of allowing you to share it with us all, thereby, leaving us so blessed! This one definitely takes me to places I so enjoy visiting!I would recommend this album to everyone who's a Robert S. Kelly (R.Kelly) fan and those who aren't, you soon will be!Peace All!Donna E.

          "text": "I really agonized over this review for a couple of days concerning what I would say about this album. I've read many reviews of this album, and all of the reviews gave In Awe of You a positive review. I wonder if these reviewers listened to the same CD I did, because I found this debut lacking in so many ways. I can't deny that Izzy is a good looking man of God. He kind of reminds me of Donell Jones, with that hat and leather jacket. Unfortunately, Izzy's CD cover is about the best thing going for him, musically. From the first, second, and third listen, Izzy is not distinguishable from any other newfangled gospel artist or mainstream R&B; don. I don't like comparing gospel artists to secular ones, but Izzy sounds like Usher-lite to me--with a weaker voice (if that's possible) and weaker production.Upon the fifth listen, \"Destiny\" is starting to sound good. Izzy's vocals are earnest, but just don't reach the convincing intensity that the song aspires to. In fact, his background singers, who are a bit shrill, out sing him in the end.Largely, Izzy shines the most on the choruses, perhaps because the addition of other vocals bolsters his thin voice. I'm no musical technician (I did play piano for a number of years though), but Awe's production seems to lack something. At times it just sounds chintzy, like the sound effects in \"You Are.\" The phantom \"awws\" remind me of the muffled sounds of a baby or cat crying in the background. The Gospel Flava review stated that most of the songwriting and production were in Izzy's hands. If so, that explains it. Maybe he wanted to save $.\"In Awe Of You\" and \"Never Let Go Your Hand\" are the \"worshipful\" cuts on the album. Again, you need more than a pretty piano and clich&eacute;d lyrics to convey the emotion of utter awe and reverence to the Lord. Staying on key helps too--at least for the listener. Nuff said.However, the worst offense by far is Izzy's cover of \"Heaven\" by Bebe and Cece Winans. Izzy's voice is smooth but does not possess the robust quality of Bebe's tenor. Likewise, the female lead fails to capture Cece's crystal clear and contemplative soprano.The one bright spot... I am so glad \"All This Love\" is not a cover of the 1982 Debarge classic. I would have been hopping mad if Izzy had botched it. Actually \"All This Love\" is one of the bright spots on the CD. It has a nice thumping beat, harmonic background vocals, an obligatory bridge rap, but overall clear lead vocals.I hate to say this, but you're better off downloading this than buying this misguided attempt at being awe-inspiring.",

Her love for her listeners is palpable throughout each piece. As Shaina has said, these ten songs are pieces, which helped her on her own personal journey, and I am sure they will nurture and inspire anyone who takes the time to listen. Just open your heart, relax, and allow the positive messages and majestic power of these songs to course through you.Each song contains beautiful orchestrations, exceedingly powerful lyrics, and messages of love, healing and unity. They teach us to honor mother earth, all her inhabitants, and ourselves. Shaina has a warm, rich and highly expressive voice sent straight from Heaven, and sure to sooth your soul. The variety of material here is fantastic... from the reflective and encouraging \"Brother Warrior\", to the achingly lovely \"Only Make Believe\" and the delightfully soulful final track, \"Sometimes It's Easy\", every song presented is a gem, sparkling with vibrancy, intensity and power! This is music that simply must be heard, felt, and lived! This is one musical journey you truly should not miss!!! Allow Shaina and this exceptional music to guide, encourage and inspire you. I am a better person for having listened. Thank you, Shaina, from the bottom of my heart. I can't recommend this album highly enough! Please, \"Listen, Listen!\"",

I no longer have the CD since earlier in this decade I purchased the entire Ella Fitzgerald Songbook box set (which is obviously even more amazing than this compilation--And which I will eventually review on Amazon). I'm listening to the \"Best of the Songbooks\" MP3 as I write this. Although I wouldn't have had to to write this review--Because the tunes of Ella's included on it that I love are indelibly etched in my musical memory. Ella's music is healing, positive, inspiring. Her way with a song defies analysis. She can be funny, light and warm--Yet there is also an underlying sadness in her voice and sensibility. Not to mention an understanding of the blues--Musically as well as spiritually. Although I have my personal favorites--Most numbers that Ella tackles she inevitably makes her own. So even those I consider to be her \"B-List\" numbers have their appeal as well. Highlights for me on this disc tend to be the upbeat numbers and include the opening cut \"Something's Got to Give\"; \"I've Got my Love to Keep me Warm\" and \" 'S Wonderful\". My favorite ballads are: \"Love is Here to Stay\" and \"Love for Sale\". Some of Ella's ballads--IE \"Why was I Born?\" and \"Every Time We Say Goodbye\" are so heartbreaking that I can't listen to them too often. In closing--The time that the Songbook series was recorded in (1956-1964) is often referred to as Ella's peak period, due to the quality of her voice at that time. That being said--Her work in the 1970's was also great--Particularly on \"Ella in London\" (1974) and \"Ella Fitzgerald at the Montreux Jazz Festival\" (1975)--Both of which I have also reviewed on Amazon. If you want to hear Ella improvising at her best--Get those records too !!!!Stephen C. Bird, author of \"Hideous Exuberance: A Satire\"",

This song accurately describes what I've gone through for years with:\"They can say,ANYthing they WANT to say to TRY to\"bring me down\",but I will NOT\"allow ANYone to succeed,hanging\"clouds\"over me,and they can try HARD,to make me FEEL,that I don't matter at all,but I REFUSE to fall..\" \"See I HAVE learned,there's another peace I own;something in my SOUL,that THEY canNOT posess;so I WON'T be afraid,and the darkness will FADE..\" I just LOVE how Mariah emphatically declares this UNDENIABLE truth:\"NOOOOO,they can't take this precious love that I'll ALWAYS have inside me;CERTAINLY the Lord will guide me where I NEED to GO!!\" \"Cause there's a LIGHT in ME,that SHINES so BRIGHTLY!!\" They can TRY,but they CAN'T take THAT away from me!!\" \"And THEY can DO anything they want TO do,IF you LET them in,but they will NEVER\"win\",if you cling TO your pride(which is{contrary to OVERLY-pious folk}NOT always a\"bad\"thing to have in moderation as God actually detests those who are FULL of vain-pride)and just push them ASIDE.\".\"They TRY and\"break me down\".but I won't(even)FACE the GROUND!!\" Bless Mariah for this song which has given me RENEWED vigor/determination in combating a force which even the Bible(Proverbs 27:4)asks:\"WHO is ABLE to stand before\"!! After declaring the inner fortitude that it takes to endure the relentless onslaught of ENVY(which actually creates\"silent\"(undeclared)enemies out of your\"friends\"for you....Mariah ends this album with a nuclear-level\"BANG\"as she and Luther Vandross collaborate to perform the absolute BEST singing of\"Endless Love\"to date!!This is an an all-together FANTASTIC collection of Mariahs'astonishing timeless creations!!! GET THIS QUICK,you WON'T regret it!!!",
